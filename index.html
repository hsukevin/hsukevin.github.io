                    In Fall 2015, I have the opportunity to work with on OpenChrom, an open source software for chromatography and mass spectrometry based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) with seven other students and two mentors. Its core focus is on handling mass spectrometry data files natively and offering a nicely adaptable graphical user interface. OpenChrom is tailored for data analysis purposes including processing, visualization and reporting. As I am about to start the quarter, I am ecstatic about the possibilities that this project will allow me to enhance my coding abilities and associate me with Facebook's open source philosophies.

My team and I were presented a challenge of creating an app to help consistency of pictures sent for claims. We approached the problem by creating an Android app that targetted user friendliness, picture capture automation, reusability of software, and audio instructions. Without releasing confidential information that our team signed away privately, I cannot write any more of what our app provided for AudaExplore. My team won first place and was rewarded a lump sum of $1,500.</p>

                    I was chosen by my team to be the project manager for CSE 110, Software Engineering. As project manager, I appointed tasks to the rest of the team, made executive decisions, and kepy my team on track to success. The goal of our app were to simplify the process of making to-do lists and schedules for students and allowing teachers to broadcast class schedules efficiently. Kronos is really neat because it was one of the first solutions that I had in mind to one of the daily problems that I have. Although it is far from perfect, my team and I are proud that we have come up with a working solution that would ease our lives if we were to use it. For the app, we needed to set up both a user database and an events database for users to follow. On top of that, our app needed all core features of a calendar app. I was voted as the top contributing member in the first round of peer reviews.

                    As one of ten selected leads, I commanded a team of 7 other fellow IEEE Micromouse members. Together, our goal was to build an autonomous robot that would be able to traverse a maze and compute the shortest path to the center. From doing research, buying parts online, soldering wires, we built our mouse piece by piece together as a team. It was a very involved process learning about the sensors, encoders, motors, battery, and Teensy development board that runs an ARM processor. After assembling the mouse, we wrote the code and tried to program the mouse to solve the maze. Unfortunately, one of our encoders malfunctioned near the date of the competition and we were unable to participate. I would love to participate in the Micromouse competition again, but it is far too time consuming. I realized that it is, indeed, rather a fascinating feat to finish but I would rather spend my time coding up my next application. Nonetheless, it was a worthwhile experience in that I learned that I would rather focus solely on software rather than mechanical specs. It helped in finding myself, which is a very important part of life.</p>

                    The online lessons that I completed were meaningful and exposed me to various types of approaches to solve problems. These courses allow me to learn outside of school at my own pace and leisure. Two courses I would like to reflect on are machine learning and scalable app development. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="textleft indented">
                    The machine learning course started off as more of a review but built up to more complex theory and algorithms. Although it didn't ask me to implement some of the harder material, it went into enough detail for me to understand the concepts and comfortably use the given python library to execute the learning algorithm. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="textleft indented">
                    As for the scalable app development, the course really does a step by step with Google App Engine and helped me deploy a prewritten web app online. It really expected you to remember previous lessons and material, so it moved at quite a fast pace for beginners. These courses are great resources that I would love to spend more time on when my time frees up from other duties and hobbies.

                    Project Euler was a pastime that I enjoyed spending time on. It is an archive of mind boggling problems that were based around coding and math. I competed with my friends to see who ran the fastest algorithm or solved the problem quickest. Some of the problems were quite tricky and we really had to think on how to optimize on better big O runtime because it wouldn't process the answers in acceptable time. Other problems were really annoying to solve because of the input parameters. However, I felt like these brain teasers were getting dull and wanted to pursue building something more meaningful. Rather than tackling preexisting math problems already solved by others, I want to solve a problem that I have with my own unique solution. Maybe I will return to doing more problems, but for now, I am leaving Project Euler to pursue learning different skill sets to further my skillset.

                    During the summer of 2015, I had the privilege to work with Teradata in Rancho Bernardo. I interned for the platform engineering team and had a great learning experience. My key objectives were to test the SAS HBAs for Teradata platforms, script in perl/bash for product improvement, and support lab maintenance for my team. I learned a lot about the Teradata process of introducing products, upgrading to newer software, Teradata's solutions to data storage, and perfecting quality control. I helped by supporting regression tests for multiple adapters on different nodes. I also cleaned up the script output for board, chip, and firmware information. After that, I helped set up and stabilized test systmes in preparation for the test run cycle. I learned the importance of regression testing and maintaining/updating legacy disk arrays. Finally, I installed and set up multiple nodes for an upcoming project. Most importantly, I got to network and meet a handful of great peers. I really hope to hold on to these connections and work with them in the future.

                    <p class="textleft indented">
                    As a tutor for CSE department at UCSD, I had the opportunity to work with all types of students and tutors. From teaching people who start early and get things done, to the procrastinators who turn in assignments right before the deadline, I had an eye opening experience. Students come up with many different ways to work the code, and in doing so, I get exposed to different approaches to solve the same problem. With a team of tutors, we stayed in the CSE labs and assisted students who had debugging issues or had conceptual problems on how things worked. Upon becoming promoted to a head tutor, I lead the tutors and handle the majority of the coursework's material. I update discussion slides, manage assignments, run queries on the web portal, set administration rights, as well as take full responsibility of the course (asides from the professor, of course). I really enjoyed my time as a head tutor.
